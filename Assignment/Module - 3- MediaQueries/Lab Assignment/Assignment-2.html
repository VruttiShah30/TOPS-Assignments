            <h1>The Power of Good Typography in Web Design</h1>
            <h2>How fonts, spacing, and Responsive improve readability</h2>
            <p>
                Typography is one of the most important elements in web design. It shapes how users read, understand, and engage with content. Choosing the right fonts and maintaining proper spacing can transform a simple layout into a professional and user-friendly experience.

            <p>
                Headings should stand out and guide readers through the content, which is why a serif font like Merriweather works beautifully. For the body, a clean sans-serif font such as Roboto improves clarity and reduces eye strain during long reading sessions.
            </p>

            <p>
                Responsive typography ensures your blog looks great on all devices. By adjusting font sizes and spacing through media queries, you create a layout that adapts smoothly to mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.
